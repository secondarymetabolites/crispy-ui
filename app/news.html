      We just released version 1.1.0 of CRISPy-web with some bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback.
      <h4>Highlights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>All results are being shown.</strong><br>
          The previous version did a stricter filtering for sgRNA quality. This
          turned out to limit the usefullness in some use cases. We now
          always show all results, sorted from least to most off-target hits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easier to localise sgRNAs.</strong><br>
          For sgRNAs that are located within an annotated ORF, the identifier
          of the ORF is now also shown. This should make it easier to keep track
          of which sgRNA belongs to which ORF.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More robust sequence parser.</strong><br>
          Previously, CRISPy-web would sometimes crash when certain invalid
          sequence files were uploaded, sometimes causing outages for all
          CRISPy-web users. The new version should be much more robust to this,
          improving the overall user experience.
