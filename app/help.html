  <p>To run a Cas9 sgRNA scan for your genome region of interest, you can either
  upload a GenBank file containing the genome you want to scan for sgRNAs
  <div class="well well-sm">

  or specify an antiSMASH job ID to download the result from.

  <p>Once the sequence has been transferred, you will be able to select a region
  to scan for sgRNAs.  On top of the page is a short summary of the genome that
  was uploaded. Right below is a text field that can be used to specify the
  target region.

  </div>
  Regions can be selected by entering a range (like <code>12345-67890</code>),
  the locus tag of any gene found on the genome, or a secondary metabolite gene
  cluster as predicted by antiSMASH (if available).  The search field will
  autocomplete both locus tags and cluster names. Secondary metabolite gene
  clusters are also summarised in a table below the input field.</p>

  <p>Once a target region has been selected, a click on "Find targets" will
  start the actual scan for sgRNAs. Depending on the size of both the selected
  region and the overall genome size, this will take from a couple of minutes to
  a quarter of an hour. Once the scan has completed, you will be presented with
  a page giving an overview over the scanned region, with the genes displayed as
  arrows, and the sgRNA sites indicated as red boxes.

  To zoom in to the sgRNAs found within a specific gene, clicking on the gene
  arrow pops up a small box giving a "Show results for this gene only" link.
  After selecting that link, you will be redirected to a zoomed view of just the
  specified gene.

  Both views list the sgRNAs identified, sorted by 0 bp mismatch
  off-target count, 1 bp mismatch off-target count, 2 bp mismatch off-target
  count and location on the genome.
  Hovering over the table highlights the sgRNA box on the cluster visualisation,
  and vice versa.
  Clicking a table row adds the respective sgRNA to the download basket.
  The basket icon on the upper right displays the number of selected sgRNAs.
  Clicking on this icon takes you to the download page, where you again get an
  overview of your selected sgRNAs and an option to download your selection as a
  comma-separated table that can be opened in a spreadsheet application or text
  editor.
